# REST-Test-App

This is an example app of a very common Android use case for RESTful consumption & display of data 
with offline persistence.

## REQUIREMENTS

* Reads a JSON feed from the internet
* Parses it and shows the contents in a list
* Clicking on a list item shows a detailed view of that item
* Persists the contents of the feed locally, so if the app is used without Internet connection it will show previously downloaded content
* Compiles and runs from Android Studio

## Libraries

### HTTP & data parsing
**Retrofit** - Maintained by Square - Retrofit provides a convenient builder for constructing a data object through HTTP. It takes in a base URL which is going used for every service call, a converter factory for all of the parsing of data sent and also any responses recieved, and any HTTP client options required for successful calls.

**Gson** - Maintained by Google - Used in the aforementioned converter factory, Gson is a Java serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects to JSON objects and vice versa.

### UI
**Jetpack Compose** - Maintained by Google - A declarative UI framework in Android. Compose is Androidâ€™s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Compose boasts less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

**Coil** - Maintained by InstaCart - An acronym for Coroutine Image Loader, Coil is an image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines. 
Benefits are as follows:
  * Fast - performs a number of optimizations including memory and disk caching, downsampling the image in memory, automatically pausing/cancelling requests, and more.
  * Lightweight: Coil adds ~2000 methods to your APK (for apps that already use OkHttp and Coroutines), which is comparable to Picasso and significantly less than Glide and Fresco.
  * Easy to use: Coil's API leverages Kotlin's language features for simplicity and minimal boilerplate.
  * Modern: Coil is Kotlin-first and uses modern libraries including Coroutines, OkHttp, Okio, and AndroidX Lifecycles.

### Data Storage
**Jetpack ROOM** - Maintained by Google - An abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

### Annotation
**KSP** - Maintained by Google - Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) is an API that you can use to develop lightweight compiler plugins. KSP provides a simplified compiler plugin API that leverages the power of Kotlin while keeping the learning curve at a minimum. Compared to KAPT, annotation processors that use KSP can run up to 2x faster.
This is recommended best practice:

## Build Configuration
* Android Studio Giraffe 2022.3.1 Canary 11
* Java version 17 - Jetbrains Runtime 17.0.6
* Gradle version 8.1.1

Canary versions of Android studio were picked to support Jetpack Compose tooling and Gradle Version Catalog.

## Troubleshooting
The gradle scripts should download Gradle & JDK versions automatically, but if for whatever reason they are not set up, one can find the JDK setup as follows:

Android Studio (or "File" on Windows) -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle

And if Gradle does not update, one can find the updater here:

Tools -> AGP Upgrade Assistant

if the project still will not build, there may be a compatibility issue with the version of Android Studio being used
